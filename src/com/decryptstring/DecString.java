/*
Find k’th character of decrypted string
Given an encoded string where repetitions of substrings are represented as substring followed by 
count of substrings. For example, if encrypted string is “ab2cd2″ and k=4 , so output will be ‘b’ 
because decrypted string is “ababcdcd” and 4th character is ‘b’.

Note: Frequency of encrypted substring can be of more than one digit. For example, in “ab12c3″, 
ab is repeated 12 times. No leading 0 is present in frequency of substring.

Input: "a2b2c3", k = 5
Output: c
Decrypted string is "aabbccc"
